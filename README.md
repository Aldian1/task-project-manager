# task-project-manager

I want to build a task and project management tool with two tables: one for tasks and one for projects. The tool should include the following features:

	1.	Tables and Metrics:
	â€¢	Tasks Table:
	â€¢	Columns: Task Name, Due Date, Priority, Status, Assigned To
	â€¢	Projects Table:
	â€¢	Columns: Project Name, Start Date, End Date, Status, Owner
	2.	Ghost Row:
	â€¢	Each table should have a ghost row at the bottom.
	â€¢	When the ghost row is clicked, it should add a new empty row to the table.
	â€¢	The ghost row should always be present, even after adding new rows.
	3.	Simplicity:
	â€¢	Keep the UI simple and user-friendly.
	â€¢	Allow easy navigation between the tasks and projects tables.
	4.	Additional Options:
	â€¢	Include basic sorting and filtering options for both tables.
	â€¢	Allow editing and deleting of rows.

Please build this tool using a simple and efficient tech stack. Thank you!
